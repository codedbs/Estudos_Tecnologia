### Main goal

Present the concepts that characterize computational thinking, allowing the developer to understand what it means to think computationally.

- Thought process involved in expressing solutions in computational steps or algorithms that can be implemented on the computer.

#### 4 Pillars

- Decomposition: Divide a complex problem into subproblems
- Pattern Recognition: Identify patterns or trends
- Abstraction: Extrapolate the concept of the problem to a generalist form.
- Algorithm design
